# Titanic
Getting Started to Kaggle

https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic

## What do we need to learn?

* R/Python
* Basic theory for linear regression and classification (Introduction Machine Learning)

## Goal

* Build a classification algorithm, not matter if it is good or bad, but be able to see it working with R/Python. 
* Get our hands dirty with R/Python and machine learning
* Get knowledge

## Results

The results are published in the following kernel:

This work was based on the kernel on this other kernel:

https://www.kaggle.com/gunesevitan/titanic-advanced-feature-engineering-tutorial

We took the parts of feature engineering and data visialization from the kernel, since they are quite educational. The main change we made was to integrate all the pre-processing step into transformers, that way we can easily integrate it into a pipeline, and use for the training and test sets.\\

There is work that can be done to improve our results, specially in the part of the model used. I didn't explore too many options to be honest. The accuracy of this kernel was 0.83 with the validation set and 0.78, which is around the top 10%.
